## What is Covered
* What HTML & CSS are, what are they for

## Class Goal

By the end of class, students will understand/be able to create a simple web page using HTML and CSS.

## Introduction

* Welcome students. Introduce yourself.

  * Gauge a little bit about their technological experience.
  * Ask what interests them most about computers/programming/etc.
* Encourage students to ask questions and work together throughout the class.

## What is HTML & CSS Used For?

* HTML describes the content of a web page
* CSS describes the style of the content and page layout

## How Web Browsers Work

* Web Browser reads an HTML file (“document”)
* Calculates how the resulting web page would look like
* Incorporates style instructions from CSS
* Renders the page
* HTML document can be a local file, or something served up by a web server
* Once the web page is rendered, the browser disconnects to the web server
* Images are fetched separately

## What’s a URL?

* Uniform Resource Location
* A type of address
* A resource is: an HTML document (web page), an image, a PDF, or something else
* When clicking a link, the link contains a URL to another web page (or something else)
* Description of a resource: another HTML document (web page), an image, or other kind of resource.

## HTML Syntax

* Opening and closing tags
* Self-closing tags
* Attributes (will be covered later)
